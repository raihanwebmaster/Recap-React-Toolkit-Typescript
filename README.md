## Project Structure

- `public/`: Contains static assets.
- `src/`: Contains the source code of the application.

## State Management with Redux Toolkit

This project uses Redux Toolkit to manage the application's state. Below are some examples and configurations to help you get started.

### Configuration

The Redux store configuration is defined in `src/app/store.ts`:

```typescript
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
import rootReducer from './rootReducer';

export const store = configureStore({
  reducer: rootReducer,
});

export type AppDispatch = typeof store.dispatch;
export type RootState = ReturnType<typeof store.getState>;
```

### Usage in Components

To use the Redux state in your React components, you can use the `useSelector` and `useDispatch` hooks provided by React-Redux:

```typescript
import React from 'react';
import { useSelector, useDispatch } from 'react-redux';
import { RootState } from './app/store';
import { someAction } from './features/someSlice';

const MyComponent: React.FC = () => {
  const dispatch = useDispatch();
  const someState = useSelector((state: RootState) => state.some);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>{someState.value}</p>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch(someAction())}>Click Me</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```
